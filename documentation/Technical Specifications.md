```mermaid
erDiagram
    Organizations ||--o{ Users : has
    Organizations ||--o{ Vaults : owns
    Users ||--o{ Transactions : initiates
    Users ||--o{ Signatures : requests
    Vaults ||--o{ Transactions : processes
    Vaults ||--o{ Signatures : generates

    Organizations {
        uuid id PK
        string name
        string api_key
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }

    Users {
        uuid id PK
        uuid organization_id FK
        string username

        uuid user_id FK
        uuid vault_id FK
        string status
        string blockchain_type
        string tx_hash
        decimal amount
        jsonb metadata
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }

    Signatures {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        uuid vault_id FK
        string status
        text raw_signature
        jsonb metadata
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
```

## API DESIGN

The backend will expose a RESTful API for communication with the frontend and external systems. Here's a high-level API design:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/auth/login` | POST | User authentication |
| `/api/v1/auth/logout` | POST | User logout |

This technology stack leverages AWS services for cloud infrastructure, Golang for backend development, and React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for frontend development. It provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for the Blockchain Integration Service and Dashboard, aligning with the previously specified requirements and architectural decisions.

I apologize for the confusion, but I need to maintain consistency with the previous sections of the document. The backend was specified to be developed in Golang, not Python. Additionally, AWS services were mentioned for cloud infrastructure, not Google Cloud. I'll provide the SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS section based on the technologies and choices made in the earlier sections of the SRS document.

# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

## AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

The Blockchain Integration Service and Dashboard will implement a robust authentication and authorization system to ensure secure access to the platform.

### Authentication

1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
   - Users will be required to set up MFA using one of the following methods:
     - Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)
     - SMS-based verification
     - Hardware security keys (e.g., YubiKey)

2. Password Policy
   - Minimum length: 12 characters
   - Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Password history: prevent reuse of last 5 passwords
   - Maximum age: 90 days

3. JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
   - Used for maintaining user sessions
   - Short expiration time (15 minutes) with refresh token mechanism

4. API Key Authentication
   - For programmatic access to the API
   - Rotated regularly (every 30 days)

### Authorization

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will be implemented with the following roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Admin | Full access to all system functions |
| Manager | Access to vault management, transaction processing, and analytics |
| Operator | Access to transaction processing and basic analytics |
| Auditor | Read-only access to all data for auditing purposes |
| API User | Programmatic access to specific API endpoints |

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Authenticate| B[Authentication Service]
    B -->|Validate Credentials| C[AWS Cognito]
    B -->|Generate JWT| D[JWT Service]
    D -->|Return Token| A
    A -->|Request with JWT| E[API Gateway]
    E -->|Validate Token| F[Authorization Service]
    F -->|Check Permissions| G[IAM]
    F -->|Allow/Deny| E
    E -->|Authorized Request| H[Backend Services]
```

## DATA SECURITY

The system will implement multiple layers of security to protect sensitive information:

1. Encryption at Rest
   - All data stored in RDS PostgreSQL will be encrypted using AWS-managed keys
   - S3 buckets will use server-side encryption with AWS KMS
   - ElastiCache for Redis will have encryption enabled

2. Encryption in Transit
   - All communication between services will use TLS 1.2 or higher
   - VPC peering and AWS PrivateLink for secure inter-service communication

3. Key Management
   - AWS Key Management Service (KMS) will be used for managing encryption keys
   - Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for storing and managing cryptographic keys

4. Data Masking
   - Sensitive data (e.g., private keys) will never be displayed in full
   - Logs and error messages will be sanitized to remove sensitive information

5. Secure Backup and Recovery
   - Regular encrypted backups of all databases
   - Secure, off-site storage of backup encryption keys

6. Data Access Logging
   - All data access attempts will be logged and monitored
   - Anomaly detection systems will alert on suspicious access patterns
