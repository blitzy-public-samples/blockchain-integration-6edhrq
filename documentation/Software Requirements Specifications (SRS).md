## HARDWARE INTERFACES

The Blockchain Integration Service and Dashboard is a software-based solution that does not directly interface with specific hardware components. However, it is designed to operate efficiently on the following hardware configurations:

1. Server Hardware
   - Minimum: 8-core CPU, 16GB RAM, 100GB SSD
   - Recommended: 16-core CPU, 32GB RAM, 250GB SSD
   - Network: Gigabit Ethernet interface

2. Client Hardware (for accessing the web interface)
   - Minimum: Dual-core CPU, 4GB RAM
   - Recommended: Quad-core CPU, 8GB RAM
   - Display: Minimum resolution of 1280x720

The system is designed to be hardware-agnostic and should function on any hardware capable of running the specified software stack (Golang runtime for backend, modern web browsers for frontend).

## SOFTWARE INTERFACES

The Blockchain Integration Service and Dashboard will interface with several external software systems:

1. Utxo Custodian
   - Interface: RESTful API
   - Purpose: Secure key management and signature generation
   - Data Exchanged: Vault information, signature requests, raw signatures

2. XRP Blockchain
   - Interface: XRP Ledger API
   - Purpose: Transaction submission and monitoring
   - Data Exchanged: Transaction details, account information, ledger data

3. Ethereum Blockchain
   - Interface: Ethereum JSON-RPC API
   - Purpose: Transaction submission and monitoring
   - Data Exchanged: Transaction details, account information, smart contract interactions

4. AWS Secrets Manager
   - Interface: AWS SDK for Go
   - Purpose: Secure storage and retrieval of sensitive credentials
   - Data Exchanged: Encrypted credentials, API keys

5. Redis
   - Interface: Redis client library for Go
   - Purpose: Caching and status updates
   - Data Exchanged: Temporary data, session information, real-time status updates

6. Kafka (or similar event streaming service)
   - Interface: Kafka client library for Go
   - Purpose: Event streaming for real-time data flow
   - Data Exchanged: Completed signatures, transaction updates, system events

7. PostgreSQL Database
   - Interface: PostgreSQL driver for Go
   - Purpose: Persistent data storage
   - Data Exchanged: User data, vault information, transaction records, audit logs

## COMMUNICATION INTERFACES

The Blockchain Integration Service and Dashboard will utilize the following communication interfaces:

1. HTTPS
   - Protocol: TLS 1.2 or higher
   - Purpose: Secure communication for all web-based interactions
   - Data Format: JSON for API requests and responses

2. WebSocket
   - Protocol: WSS (WebSocket Secure)
   - Purpose: Real-time updates for dashboard and status changes
   - Data Format: JSON for event data

3. gRPC
   - Protocol: HTTP/2
   - Purpose: High-performance internal communication between microservices (if applicable)
   - Data Format: Protocol Buffers

4. SMTP
   - Protocol: SMTP with STARTTLS
   - Purpose: Sending email notifications and alerts
   - Data Format: MIME

5. SNS (Amazon Simple Notification Service)
   - Protocol: HTTPS
   - Purpose: Push notifications for critical system events
   - Data Format: JSON

6. VPC Peering
   - Protocol: AWS VPC Peering
   - Purpose: Secure communication between AWS services within the same region
   - Data Format: Native AWS network traffic

7. API Gateway
   - Protocol: HTTPS
   - Purpose: Managing and securing external API access
   - Data Format: JSON for API requests and responses

All communication interfaces will implement appropriate encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms to ensure the security and integrity of data in transit. The system will use industry-standard protocols and data formats to facilitate interoperability and ease of integration with external systems.

I apologize, but I need to maintain consistency with the previous sections of the SRS document. The backend was specified to be developed in Golang, not Python. Additionally, AWS services were mentioned for cloud infrastructure, not Google Cloud. I'll provide the APPENDICES section based on the technologies and choices made in the earlier sections of the SRS document.

# APPENDICES
